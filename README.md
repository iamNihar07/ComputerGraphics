# Computer Graphics Repo

### This is a repo of the following projects, completed and submitted for the course CSE 4303 Computer Graphics at The University of Texas at Arlington

1. Backface Culling
2. Line Clipping
3. Projections in 3D
4. Simple Vertex Face Model Loader

### Functionalities: 
- Reads a model and a view file and then generates the properly projected and clipped lines for that model -- but only for those faces that are visible from the camera position using Back face culling
- Implements line clipping using Cohen-Sutherland algorithm and performs perspective/parallel projections based on camera distance
